Starting communication with battery...
⚠️ If you receive NACK : ⚠️
  - This code is specific to Mavic Air 1 + Arduino MEGA 2560, some parameters may change if you have another configuration
  - Your battery is maybe not well connected to arduino
      - Verify connexion, you can find screenshot of how to connect in github repo. https://github.com/gvnt/mavic-air-battery-helper
  - Your battery is maybe completely discharge and cannot communicate, you need to open it and charge if a bit manually
      - You can find screenshot of how to open and recharge manually in github repo. https://github.com/gvnt/mavic-air-battery-helper

Bit 0 (PRES): 0 = Inactive - System Present (low)
Bit 1 (DSG): 0 = Inactive - Discharge FET status
Bit 2 (CHG): 0 = Inactive - Charge FET status
Bit 3 (PCHG): 0 = Inactive - Precharge FET status
Bit 4 (RSVD): 0 =  - Reserved
Bit 5 (FUSE): 0 = Inactive - Fuse status
Bit 6 (RSVD): 0 =  - Reserved
Bit 7 (BTP_INT): 0 = Inactive - Battery Trip Point Interrupt
